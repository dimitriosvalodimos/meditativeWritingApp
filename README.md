# Meditative Writing Website

This site was created simply for the purpose of having a very minimalistic text editor for creative/meditative writing.
The entire page was built using SvelteJS, though I might try to do it in Vanilla JavaScript later down the line.

## Usage
It's faily simple:
You start typing whatever is on your mind (the righthand site provides some maybe helpful questions to get you going)
Then you enter a name for your file and press "Save", which will download your text as a .txt file with the given filename.
If you leave the filename input blank, the site will default to a name made up of your current date (YYYY-MM-DD.txt).
